# ATM-SIMULATION
## About
This application was built in C++ with the aim to practice my C++ code. I wrote it using the procedural programming paradigm.
## Features
The application features a console window where the user can interact with an ATM-like interface. The user can input several different commands to interact with the system and their account: logging in, withdrawing, depositing, etc.
